Part 1: Project Setup: Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies for building and running an Express server. Write a basic Express server and ensure it runs properly.

 Part 2: Implementing a Signup Endpoint Your task is to create an endpoint that allows new users to register on your server. 
 
 This endpoint should be responsible for handling user registration by accepting and processing the following details: Username Email Password Date of Birth The request will send this information to your server, and your implementation should validate the input before proceeding with the signup process.
 
  Requirements for the input fields Username: Username can not be empty Return an error message: "Username cannot be empty" if not provided. 
  
  Email: Email can not be empty Return an error message: "Email cannot be empty" if not provided. Password: Minimum length: 8 characters. Maximum length: 16 characters. 
  
  If the password is too short or too long, return the error: "Password length should be greater than 8 or less than or equal to 16". (Use simple if-else conditions for validating input fields) Part 3: Finalizing and Deploying the Project Push all changes to Git: Initialize a Git repository in your project directory. 
  
  Add and commit all the code written so far. Add node modules to git ignore. Push the code to a Git repository on a platform like GitHub. 
  
  Deploy the Backend: Deploy the backend to a backend deployment service (e.g., Render). Ensure the server is running and accessible from the internet.
